What government agencies regulate the restaurant and food service industry?
National, state, and local government food safety agencies regulate the restaurant and food service industry in every country. They are responsible for creating food laws and regulations that aim to create food standards for food preparation, provide nutritious food, and protect public health from foodborne illnesses. Food safety agencies emphasize how food regulations are important for protecting public health.

The scope and limitation of each agency's authority over the industry practices vary from one country to another. In one nation, there may be more than two food safety agencies, whereas there are countries that have one agency with the sole responsibility of regulating the food service sector.

 

In the U.S., the food service industry is mainly regulated by three government agencies:

Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This federal agency regulates approximately 78% of the U.S. food supply. The food and health agency establishes and monitors food safety regulations for handling, processing, labeling, packaging, and the delivery of foods in and out of the country. It also conducts food safety inspections to ensure food safety compliance. The FDA works with local health departments to implement food regulations.
U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Services (USDA FSIS). This federal agency is responsible for monitoring safety and establishing food safety laws regarding products such as meats, poultry, and egg products. The FSIS also conducts training and outreach programs to food businesses to help them comply with the necessary laws.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This federal agency conducts research and programs that help the nation understand food safety practices more deeply to protect public health. They are also responsible for conducting investigations and monitoring cases of food safety outbreaks.
 

In the U.K., food safety agencies are not divided into different departments. 

Food Standards Agency (FSA). The food service industry is mainly governed by the Food Standards Agency FSA. The agency is responsible for implementing food safety laws and monitoring food hygiene within England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The agency works with local authorities to regulate food handling and production to ensure the safety of public health. It provides the necessary policies for food businesses to run as safely as possible.
Food Standards Scotland. This agency is the public food agency for Scotland. It is responsible for ensuring food safety in the foods being produced and handled in Scotland. It also provides guidance for food businesses in Scotland on how to comply with food safety laws. 
In both countries, federal agencies coordinate with local and state health departments to implement food safety laws. They are responsible for ensuring compliance among food businesses and reporting to federal agencies regarding food safety issues. Local health agencies also monitor health code violations.

All food safety and health agencies work toward protecting public health and helping food businesses work seamlessly.

Which organization makes recommendations for food safety regulations in the food service industry?
In the U.S., the FDA creates recommendations on food safety operations that are regularly compiled and updated under the Food Code. These recommendations are adapted throughout different states and are enforced as laws and regulations. They cover a wide range of food safety operations, including receiving, handling, storing, preparing, cooking, and cleaning in food businesses. 

As previously mentioned, in the U.K., food safety laws are enforced by the Food Standards Agency. The agency enforces laws established in the Food Safety Act of 1990. In addition to this main law, the FSA makes suggestions for amendments and new regulations based on the extensive information that it gathers from local health departments.
